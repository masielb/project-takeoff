**Project Takeoff will be lifting off soon. Stay tuned for updates.**

# PROJECT TAKEOFF
Our product enables users to access both historical and current weather data and surface pictures by utilizing information collected by NASA's Mars Rover Program, located 750,000 miles away on the surface of Mars. The interactive pages will guide the user through the vast collection of photographs taken by NASA's three rovers, allowing the user to not only tailor their search inquery by date and specific rover, but also allow the user to save their favorite images to their own gallery. Under the narrative guise of booking a trip to Mars, the website intends to offer a fun, interactive way for the user to view, explore, and learn about the Red Planet.
